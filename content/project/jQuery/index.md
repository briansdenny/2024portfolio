## Problem
As Senior Technical Writer and Whatfix Lead at Consensus Cloud Solutions, part of my role entails transitioning a small group of technical writers away from traditional, single-source authoring and towards the regular design, creation, management, and analysis of in-app, just-in-time digital adoption microcontent. One aspect of this transition involves teaching my team how to utilize the web apps' underlying elements to customize the digital adoption content. This involves identifying HTML elements through jQuery or CSS selectors and including the selectors in Whatfix display rules. Given that my team has no prior involvement in web development and we work asynchronously, I needed to create a training document that my team could reference at their convenience.

## Solution
I compiled [these step-by-step instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FHIZ73Q7WXiBeULPJdtQnU52fh-oQejYHUzkf4KBCPM/edit?usp=sharing) as an easy reference sheet my team could use to begin exploring the process of identifying jQuery selectors.
