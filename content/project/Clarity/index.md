## Problem
Product leadership at Consensus Cloud Solutions wanted to shape an upcoming sales campaign but found the existing marketing material both too complex and too vague to entice potential customers. I was asked to write several shorter, more compelling marketing pieces for potential inclusion in a future email campaign. 

## Solution
After reviewing the existing marketing material, I devised a list of questions to ensure I sufficiently understood the product. After gathering responses to those questions from SMEs in the Product department, I began writing. My goal was to create concise and catchy pieces that emphasized the brand name and functionality.
