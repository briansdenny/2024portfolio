summary: Internal teaching document with step-by-step instructions for identifying jQuery selectors and applying them to Whatfix display rules

## Problem
As Senior Technical Writer and Whatfix Lead at Consensus Cloud Solutions, part of my role entails transitioning a small group of technical writers away from traditional, single-source authoring and towards the regular design, creation, management, and analysis of in-app, just-in-time digital adoption microcontent. One aspect of this transition involves teaching my team how to utilize the web apps' underlying elements to customize the digital adoption content. One step in using these elements is identifying them through jQuery or CSS selectors and including the selectors within content display rules. Given that none of my team members have any prior experience in web development and we work asynchronously, I needed to create a training document that my team could reference at their convenience.

## Solution
I created these step-by-step instructions as an easy reference sheet my team can use to begin exploring the process of identifying jQuery selectors.
This is the description.
